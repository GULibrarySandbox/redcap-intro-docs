# The REDCap mobile app

REDCap offers a mobile app on iOS and Android. The mobile app allows for mobile, offline data input. That is, you don’t need mobile reception to use it. This can be ideal for environmental research or remote-area social research.

We won’t review it in this session, but you can download it for free and try it out.
